## Features

- **Lock-less Architecture**: Stateless agents operate without shared memory locks  
- **Multi-Core Performance**: Utilizes worker threads for true parallelism  
- **Strong Flow Control**: Managed conversation workflows with hooks    
- **Modular Design**: Pluggable agents with tool integration support  
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations with promise-based APIs. Can be integrated with broadcast channel, kafaka, sqs, pubsub, etc.

### Agents Patterns
1. **Round Robin**: Simple task distribution  
2. **Handoff**: Agent-to-agent conversation transfer  
3. **Tool Calling**: Function execution with reflection  
4. **Selector**: Intelligent agent assignment  
5. **Workflow**: Managed multi-step processes  

### Design Overview
This is an email-like messaging system. Key design elements explained below.

####    Email-like Messaging:

Each entity (Manager/Agents) has its own virtual mailbox (persistent storage)

Messages have explicit types: **NEW**, **FORWARD**, **REPLY**

All communications are asynchronous and stored

####    Message Flow:

**NEW**: End User initiates conversation with Manager

**FORWARD**: Manager routes messages to agents

**REPLY**: Agents respond to Manager (not directly to End User)

Final **REPLY**: Manager responds to End User
